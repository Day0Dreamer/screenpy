Welcome to ScreenPy's documentation!
====================================

ScreenPy provides a solid,
`SOLID <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID>`__ base
for writing maintainable test suites
following the Screenplay Pattern,
popularized by Antony Marcano.
It also provides nice test logging
through |Allure|
and support
for BDD-style
natural language test case writing.
