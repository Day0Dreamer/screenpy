screenpy-quickstart
-------------------

To quickly set up a Screenplay Pattern test suite using ScreenPy, `cd` to the folder you will use for your suite and run this command:

    screenpy-quickstart

This will set up `user_interface`, `questions`, `tasks`, and `features` directories and fill them with a simple test. For an explanation of each of these directories, head on over to the next page!
