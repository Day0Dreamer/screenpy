Actors
======

Actors are the do-ers in the screenplay. Actors set the scene, perform their hearts out, and then make dramatic assertions that will either see a happy ending or a tragic failure.

More seriously, the actors represent the users of your application, doing the things you'd expect them to do on it (or things you might not expect them to do).
